## Listening to BetonQuest (Bukkit) events

BetonQuest exposes some of its actions as Bukkit events.  
You can find these events in `org.betonquest.betonquest.api.bukkit.event` package.
[Use them as you would use any other Bukkit event](https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Event_API_Reference#The_Basics).

The event API itself is stable as the API state tells, but some events will change from time to time or get renamed/replaced.
If you need any additional events, create a discussion or pull request on GitHub.
